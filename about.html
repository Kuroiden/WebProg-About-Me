				Born on the 22nd of October in 2004 as Cloe Angelica D.C. Gorgonio in the city of Manila, Philippines, I am currently a 17-year-old Senior High School Software Development student from iAcademy, with intent to study Game Development for college at the same school. Growing up speaking in English but also learned Filipino alongside, I have gained fluency in the English language, with some skill in Filipino, and the ability to understand both languages. Despite the slight lack of skill in the Filipino language, I have managed to graduate Elementary School and move up from Junior High School, both at St. Mary's Academy of Sta. Ana, with Honors.
				<br><br>
				During my late Elementary School and early High School years, I have gained an interest in programming, starting with HTML, and CSS a bit later, in my Information and Communication Technology (ICT) subject, which I would also do during part of my summer vacation. The idea of taking up Game Development came in the same years, as I enjoyed playing such from others and make games of my own. When applying for Senior High School at iAcademy, I chose Software Development as I thought it would be a good way to familiarize myself with different programming languages, and so that I would have sufficient knowledge when entering the college course of my choice.
				<br><br>
				Aside from those stated prior, I also have interests in other fields. During high school, I have honed my skills in photo editing, as well as have improved my ability in video editing, two things I wanted to get into since the 5th grade. In my 3rd year of high school, I have tried cooking and baking, although not as often. At the around the same time, I leaned into playing Rhythm games, to which I have gained a decent capability with. I have some knowledge in photography, graphic design, translation, and small amount of knowledge in animation.
